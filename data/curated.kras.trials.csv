A new cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, growing them in the lab, genetically modifying them, then giving them back to the person. This therapy is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells.

Objective:

To see if anti-KRAS G12 V mTCR cells are safe and can shrink tumors.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with cancer that has the KRAS G12V molecule on the surface of tumors.

Design:

In another protocol, participants will:

Be screened

Have cells harvested and grown

Have leukapheresis

In this protocol, participants will have the procedures below.

Participants will be admitted to the hospital.

Over 5 days, participants will get 2 chemotherapy medicines as an infusion via catheter in the upper chest.

A few days later, participants will get the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells via catheter.

For up to 3 days, participants will get a drug to make the cells active.

A day after getting the cells, participants will get a drug to increase their white blood cell count. This will be a shot or injection under the skin.

Participants will recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. They will have lab and blood tests.

Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.

Participants will have visits every few months for 2 years, and then as determined by their doctor.

Visits will be 1-2 days. They will include lab tests, imaging studies, and physical exam. Some visits may include leukapheresis or blood drawn.

A new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person, grows them in a lab, genetically changes them, then gives them back to the person. Researchers think this may help attack tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells.

Objective:

To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18-72 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the study cells

Design:

Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and heart, lung, and lab tests.

An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest.

Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm.

A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will:

* Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days.
* Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells.
* Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples.

Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.

Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the screening tests and may have leukapheresis.

Participants blood will be collected for several years.",NO,Gastrointestinal Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer,DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: anti-KRAS G12D mTCR PBL,"Response rate, Percentage of patients who have a clinical response (PR+CR) to treatment (objective tumor regression), 6 weeks and 12 weeks following administration of the cell product, then every 3 months x3, then every 6 months x 2 years, then per PI discretion|Frequency and severity of treatment-related adverse events, Grade and type of toxicity per dose level; fraction of patients who experience a DLT at a given dose level, and number and grade of each type of DLT, From time of cell infusion to two weeks after cell infusion","","",National Cancer Institute (NCI),"",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,70,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,190017|19-C-0017,2019-05-16,2027-12-01,2028-12-01,2018-11-19,,2025-03-12,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States","",N.A.,KRAS-G12D mTCR,TCR,G12V,KRAS,2019-05-16,2028-12-01,<span style='color:#03396c'>KRAS-G12D mTCR</span>,2028-12-01,G12V

NCT04111458,A Study to Test Different Doses of BI 1701963 Alone and Combined With Trametinib in Patients With Different Types of Advanced Cancer (Solid Tumours With KRAS Mutation),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04111458,"",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This is a study in adults with advanced cancer (solid tumours) in whom previous chemotherapy was not successful. Only people who have a tumour with a KRAS mutation can participate in the study. A KRAS mutation makes cancer grow faster.

The study tests 2 medicines called BI 1701963 and trametinib. BI 1701963 prevents reactivation of KRAS. In this study, BI 1701963 is given to humans for the first time. Trametinib is an approved medicine (MEK inhibitor).

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 1701963 alone and in combination with trametinib the participants can tolerate. Another purpose is to check whether BI 1701963 in combination with trametinib is able to make tumours shrink.

Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it.

During this time, they get tablets of BI 1701963 and trametinib once daily. The doctors regularly monitor the size of the tumour. Doctors also regularly record any unwanted effects and check participants' health.",NO,"Solid Tumors, KRAS Mutation; SOS1",DRUG: BI 1701963|DRUG: Trametinib,"Dose escalation (Part A) - Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 4 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Number of patients with DLTs during the on-treatment period, Up to 3 years|Dose confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Objective response, Up to 3 years","Dose escalation (Part A), confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 1701963: Cmax (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma), Up to 5 weeks|Dose escalation (Part A), confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 1701963: AUCτ (area under the concentration-time curve over a uniform dosing interval τ), Up to 5 weeks|Dose escalation (Part A), confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of trametinib: Cmax (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma), Up to 5 weeks|Dose escalation (Part A), confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of trametinib: AUCτ (area under the concentration-time curve over a uniform dosing interval τ), Up to 5 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 1701963: Cmax (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma), Up to 5 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of BI 1701963: AUC0-tz (area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 to the last quantifiable data point), Up to 5 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam: Cmax (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma), Up to 5 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam: AUC0-tz (area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma over the time interval from 0 to the last quantifiable data point), Up to 5 weeks|Dose confirmation (Part B) - Number of patients with Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events observed during the on-treatment period, Up to 3 years|Dose confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Duration of Objective response (OR), Up to 3 years|Dose confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Tumour shrinkage (in millimetres), Up to 3 years|Dose confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Progression-free survival, 6 months|Dose confirmation (Part B) and expansion (Part C) - Number of patients with Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events observed during the on-treatment period, Up to 3 years","",Boehringer Ingelheim,"",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,71,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SEQUENTIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1432-0001|2018-004757-24,2019-11-04,2025-12-31,2025-12-31,2019-10-01,,2025-03-25,"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, North Carolina, 28204, United States|Sarah Cannon Research Institute-Nashville-48456, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203, United States|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Universitätsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, 60590, Germany|Universitätsklinikum Köln (AöR), Köln, 50937, Germany|Erasmus Medisch Centrum-ROTTERDAM-50697, Rotterdam, 3015 GD, Netherlands|Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht, Utrecht, 3584 CX, Netherlands","",C166138,BI1701963,Inhibitor,SOS1:SHP2,SOS1,2019-11-04,2025-12-31,<span style='color:#aa2000'>BI1701963</span>,2025-12-31,SOS1:SHP2

This study will be in 2 parts.

In Part 1, different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP3082 by itself, or together with cetuximab. Any medical problems will be recorded at each dose. This is done to find suitable doses of ASP3082, by itself or together with cetuximab, to use in Part 2 of the study. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP3082. A medical expert panel will check the results from this group and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP3082. The panel will do this for each group until all groups have received ASP3082 (by itself or together with cetuximab) or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.

In Part 2, ASP3082 will be given in by itself, or in combination with other chemotherapy agents.

Study treatments will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 or 28 days long.

NCT06364696,A Study to Find a Suitable Dose of ASP4396 in Adults With Solid Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06364696,"",RECRUITING,"Genes contain genetic code which tell the body which proteins to make. Some types of cancer are caused by changes, or mutations, in a gene called KRAS. Researchers are looking for ways to stop the actions of abnormal proteins made from the mutated KRAS gene. The so-called G12D mutation in the KRAS gene is common in people with some solid tumors.

ASP4396 is being developed as a potential new treatment for solid tumors in people who have the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. ASP4396 is not currently available as a treatment for the public. In this study, researchers will learn how ASP4396 is processed by and acts upon the body. This information will help find a suitable dose and to check for potential medical problems from ASP4396.

In this study, ASP4396 is being given to humans for the first time.

People in this study will be adults with locally advanced (unresectable), or metastatic solid tumors with the G12D mutation in their KRAS gene. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. They may have been previously treated with standard therapies or refused to receive those treatments.

The main aims of the study are to check the safety of ASP4396, how well people cope with medical problems during the study (how well it is tolerated), and to find a suitable dose of ASP4396.

This is an open-label study. This means that people in this study and clinic staff will know that they will receive ASP4396.

This study will be in 2 parts.

Part 1 is called Dose Escalation. Different small groups of people will receive lower to higher doses of ASP4396. For each dose, all medical problems will be recorded. The first group will receive the lowest dose of ASP4396. A medical expert panel will check the results and decide if the next group can receive a higher dose of ASP4396. The panel will do this until all groups have taken ASP4396 or until suitable doses have been selected for Part 2.

Part 2 is called Dose Expansion. Other different small groups of people will receive ASP4396 with the most suitable doses worked out from Part 1. This will help find a more accurate dose of ASP4396 to use in future studies.

In both parts of the study, ASP4396 will be given through a vein. This is called an infusion. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long. People will continue treatment until: they have medical problems from the treatment they can't cope with (can't tolerate); their cancer gets worse; they start other cancer treatment; or they ask to stop treatment.

People will visit the clinic on certain days during their treatment, with extra visits during the first 2 cycles of treatment. The study doctors will check for any medical problems from ASP4396. Also, people in the study will have a health check including blood tests. On some visits they will also have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. Tumor samples will be taken at certain visits during treatment with the option of a tumor sample being taken after treatment has finished.

People will visit the clinic about 7 days after they stop treatment. They will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check including blood tests.

After this, people will visit the clinic for a health check several times. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their treatment or not.

Many cancer cells produce substances called antigens that are unique to each cancer. These antigens stimulate the body s immune responses. One approach to treating these cancers is to take disease-fighting white blood cells from a person, change those cells so they will target the specific proteins (called antigens) from the cancer cells, and return them to that person s blood. The use of the white blood cells in this manner is one form of gene therapy. A vaccine may help these modified white cells work better.

Objective:

To test a cancer treatment that uses a person s own modified white blood cells along with a vaccine that targets a specific protein.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 to 72 years with certain solid tumors that have spread after treatment.

Design:

Participants will undergo leukapheresis: Blood is removed from the body through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. The blood passes through a machine that separates out the white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body through a second needle.

Participants will stay in the hospital for 3 or 4 weeks. They will take chemotherapy drugs for 1 week to prepare for the treatment. Then their modified white cells will be infused through a needle in the arm. They will take other drugs to prevent infections after the infusion.

The vaccine is injected into a muscle; participants will receive their first dose of the vaccine on the same day as their cell infusion.

Participants will have follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the cell infusions. They will receive 2 or 3 additional doses of the boost vaccine during these visits.

Follow-up will continue for 5 years, but participants will need to stay in touch with the gene therapy team for 15 years.

This study is seeking participants who have solid tumors (a mass of abnormal cells that forms a lump or growth in the body) that:

* are advanced (cancer that doesn't disappear or stay away with treatment) and
* have a KRAS gene mutation (a change in the DNA of the KRAS gene that can cause cells to grow in very high numbers).

This includes (but limited to) the following cancer types:

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): It's a type of lung cancer where the cells grow slowly but often spread to other parts of the body.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC): This is a disease where cells in the colon (a part of large intestine) or rectum grow out of control.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): This is a cancer that starts in the ducts of the pancreas but can spread quickly to other parts of the body. Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.

All participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07934040) as pill by mouth twice a day repeating for 21-day or 28-day cycles.

Depending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07934040 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at various times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.

Participants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07934040) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.

The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.

NCT06659341,A Phase I Study of BAY3498264 Given Together With Sotorasib in Participants Who Have Advanced Solid Cancers With Specific Genetic Changes Called KRASG12C Mutation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06659341,"",RECRUITING,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid cancers with a KRASG12C mutation.

Sotorasib is a drug that targets cancer cells which contain mutated KRASG12C protein; it can stop the cancer cells from growing and can lead to their death. Sotorasib is already approved to be used by doctors. However, when sotorasib works, it normally only works for a period of time, after which the cancer starts to grow again, and the patient may need a different treatment.

BAY3498264 is a drug that is currently under development. It is expected to prevent the activity of a protein called son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). The SOS1 protein works together with KRAS; by blocking the activity of SOS1 with BAY3498264, it is hoped that the benefit offered by treatment with sotorasib may be increased - for example, resulting in a longer or deeper response.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn how safe BAY3498264 is when given together with sotorasib and what is the maximum dose of BAY3498264 that can be safely given to participants together with sotorasib.

During the study, participants will receive the following treatments:

* BAY3498264: participants will first receive BAY3498264 alone for seven days and then BAY3498264 in combination with sotorasib. These combination treatments will be given in cycles, each lasting 21 days.
* Sotorasib: participants will receive a standard, approved dose of Sotorasib once every day with BAY3498264.

The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe medical problems or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment, or until their cancer starts to grow again despite the treatment (also called 'progression').

This study has 3 parts, the dose escalation part, the backfill part and the expansion part.

During the study, researchers will collect blood, urine, and take imaging scans like CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, and examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG).

Anti-cancer therapy is a type of treatment to stop the growth of cancer.

This study also aims to find the best amount of study medication.

This study is seeking participants who have solid tumors (a mass of abnormal cells that forms a lump or growth in the body) that:

* are advanced (cancer that doesn't disappear or stay away with treatment) and
* have a KRAS gene mutation (a change in the DNA of the KRAS gene that can cause cells to grow in very high numbers).

This includes (but limited to) the following cancer types:

* Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): It's a type of lung cancer where the cells grow slowly but often spread to other parts of the body.
* Colorectal Cancer (CRC): This is a disease where cells in the colon (a part of large intestine) or rectum grow out of control.
* Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): This is a cancer that starts in the ducts of the pancreas but can spread quickly to other parts of the body. Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.

All participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07985045) as pill by mouth once a day. This will be repeated for 21-day or 28-day cycles.

Depending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07985045 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at different times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.

Participants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07985045) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.

The study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.

Participants will be in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, the participants will come into the clinic for 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After the participants have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing",NO,"Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal|Colorectal Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",DRUG: PF-07985045|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Gemcitabine|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Nab-paclitaxel|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Cetuximab|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Fluorouracil|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Oxaliplatin|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Leucovorin|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Bevacizumab|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Pembrolizumab|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Sasanlimab|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: pemetrexed|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Cisplatin|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Paclitaxel|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Carboplatin|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: PF-07284892,"Part 1 & 2: Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study medication without regard to possibility of causal relationship to it.

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer affects the organs (such as the stomach, large and small intestine, pancreas, colon, liver, and biliary system) of the digestive tract. In some participants who have had surgery for GI cancer, blood tests show that the cancer has spread despite being unable to be identified by scans. Certain gene mutations (changes) in GI cancer (such as KRAS or TP53) can be targeted by T cells, a type of immune cell, in individuals with specific HLA types (genes that help proteins in the body know what is self and non-self). Researchers want to see if they can stop GI cancer from returning or spreading in people with these gene mutations and specific HLA types.

Objective:

To test therapy with modified T-cells to prevent or delay the return of GI cancer after standard treatment. T-cells play a role in the body s immune system.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 to 72 years with GI cancer that was treated with standard therapy and is not seen on imaging scans. They must have specific gene mutations and HLA types. They also must have certain clinical or blood tests showing the cancer is spreading (elevating CA19-9 or detectable ctDNA).

Design:

Participants will be divided into 2 groups. Participants nor the study team can choose what Group to participate in; this is done by randomization , like flipping a coin. Participants will have a 1-to-1 chance of being in Group 1 or Group 2.

Group 1 will receive T-cell therapy. Their own T-cells will be collected. In a lab, the cells will be combined with a virus that carries a protein to target cancer cells.

Group 1 participants will stay in the hospital for 3 weeks or more. They will have chemotherapy, and their modified T-cells will be infused through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein.

Group 1 participants will visit the clinic every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 5 years. Then they will have follow-up visits for another 10 years under a different protocol.

Group 2 participants will not receive treatment with T-cells. They will visit the clinic every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 5 years.",NO,Gastrointestinal Carcinoma|Pancreatic Cancer|Hepatocellular Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma|Duodenal Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Small Bowel Cancer|Metastatic Cancers,BIOLOGICAL: KRAS TCR-Transduced PBL|DRUG: Aldesleukin|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide,"Recurrence free survival (RFS), RFS will be assessed with tumor markers and radiographic findings in each group and reported using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals on the median RFS in each group., 12 weeks then every 3 months x 3, every 6 months after that until progression or 5 years since randomization.","Overall survival (OS), OS will be assessed in each group and reported using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals on the median OS in each group., 12 weeks then every 3 months x 3, every 6 months after that until progression or 5 years since randomization.
